# Mathematical Operations on a numpy Array

## Arithetic operations
----
Addition:

```c = a + b```   where a, b, c are three numpy arrays

Subtraction:

```c = a - b```   where a, b, c are three numpy arrays

Multiplication:

```c = a * b```   where a, b, c are three numpy arrays

Division:

```c = a / b```   where a, b, c are three numpy arrays


## Scientific Operations
---

to find logarithm of all elements of the array

c = np.log(a) 

find square root of all elements of the array

```d = np.sqrt(a) ```

find standard deviation of the array 

```e = np.std(a)  ```

find sin of all elements of the array

```f = np.sin(a) ```

find cos of all elements of the array

```g = np.cos(a) ``` 

Find sum of all elements of the array

```h = np.sum(a) ```  

## Special sum operation

Sum across columns

```numpy.sum(axis = 0)```

Sum across rows

```numpy.sum(axis = 1)```
